GymWebApp
Expectation
The main expectatuion of this project was to provide a CRUD application with supporting documentation, testing and utilisation of all revelant tools explored in the past few weeks. I had to ensure my application allowed a user to create, read(view), update and delete.
I have included the following 
1.A trello board
2.A relation database, consisting of four tables
3.Documentation of the design phase, architecture and risk assessment matrix.
4.A C# based functional application allowing for CRUD functions

My Approach.
I produced a GymWebApp that allowed for the following
1. A Gymnast to be created that contained the following values:
- Name
- Age
- AgeSection
- Nationality
- PictureURL
- Apparatus
- CreatedAt
- ID
- 2.A Judge who would be assigned to a gymnast for each appartus which contained the following values:
- ID
- Name
- AgeSection
- Apparatus
- GymnastID
